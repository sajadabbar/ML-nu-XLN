We employ machine learning methodologies to identify fast neutrino flavor instabilities induced by the heavy-lepton flavor of neutrinos within a dense neutrino gas. This Python Jupyter Notebook outlines some of the key methodologies discussed in the paper "Detecting Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions with Machine Learning", S. Abbar and H. Nagakura (arXiv:2310.03807).
